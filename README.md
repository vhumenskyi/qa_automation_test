# QA automation assignment

This assignment is meant to evaluate the QA Automation proficiency of full-time engineers.

## Evaluation points in order of importance

- correctly defined test cases in BDD format
- edge cases are covered by tests
- readiness for CI
- correct error messages
- use of docker
- documentation: README and inline code comments

Results: please share a git repository with us containing your implementation.

Level of experience targeted: EXPERT

Choose any automation tool. Cypress is a plus.
Try to progress as far as you can in 2 hours.
If you have questions please make some assumptions and collect in writing your interpretations.

Good luck.

Time limitations: time is measured from when we send you the assignment to the final commit time onto your repository.

## Technical test

Given an application(oos_ca). Run it using the instructions in README.md. Observe the application functionality, assuming that it works correctly.
Create automation framework that will make sure that behavior stays consistent in future versions.  
Create documentation on how to work with your test framework.
Have at least two test suites. 

## Bonus points

- Use Docker for tests
- Measure performance of different UI operations 


## Note

**Tests could be found under cypress\integration folder in feature files moveTest.feature, searchTests.feature**
